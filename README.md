# 🏥 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

An AI-driven web application built with Streamlit that enables user-friendly prediction of multiple diseases including Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, Lung Cancer, and Hypo‑Thyroid using trained ML models. Diagnosis is quick, intuitive, and respects user data privacy.


🎯 Problem Statement

Early detection of diseases significantly improves treatment outcomes. However, many users lack access to diagnostic tools or medical expertise. This project aims to:

* Provide accessible disease risk prediction through simple user inputs.

* Offer predictions for multiple conditions using well-trained ML models.

* Ensure data privacy through encrypted storage and secure handling.

🚀 Features

Multiple Disease Prediction: Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, Lung Cancer, and Hypo‑Thyroid.

* Streamlit UI: Clean, intuitive interface with dropdowns, form input fields, and results display.

* AI‑Powered Models: Classifiers trained using Scikit‑Learn or TensorFlow/Keras, saved in .sav or .pkl files.

* Secure Data Handling: Patient inputs encrypted or stored in SQLite / Firebase depending on configuration.

* Model Interpretability: Optional confidence scores or bar charts to understand feature importance.

🏗️ System Architecture

The diagram above (click to download PNG) shows:

* User Interface (Streamlit) → collects medical inputs.

* Pre-processing Module → validates and normalizes inputs.

* Model Inference Engine → runs one of several disease prediction models.

* Result Display → outputs prediction and confidence.

* Secure Cloud Storage → optional persistence using encrypted SQLite or Firebase backend.

🛠️ Installation & Setup


* git clone <your‑repo‑URL>
* cd disease‑prediction‑ml
* python -m venv venv
* source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
* venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
* pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

streamlit run app.py

Once the app is running, open the browser (http://localhost:8501). Then:

* Choose a disease from the dropdown.

* Enter required medical inputs (e.g., age, blood sugar, BMI, etc.).

* Click Predict.

* View the diagnosis along with confidence score/chart.

* Optionally save your data securely.

📈 Performance

* Diabetes model: Accuracy ~92%

* Heart Disease: Accuracy ~90%

* Parkinson’s: Accuracy ~89%

* Lung Cancer & Hypo‑Thyroid: Accuracy estimates ~85–90%

* Optional confusion matrix or ROC curve plots for evaluation


🔒 Privacy & Security

* User inputs are validated and optionally encrypted.

* No patient data is stored unless configured with secure backend.

* Use best practices (OWASP, encrypted storage, hashed data handling).


📅 Future Enhancements

* 🌐 Expand datasets for better accuracy and coverage

* 💬 Integrate chatbot-based symptom intake

* 🧠 Add CNN-based X‑ray or MRI image analysis for image-enabled disease prediction

* 📊 Provide model explainability (e.g., SHAP or LIME visualizations)

* ☁️ Deploy via Streamlit Cloud or AWS with authentication layer
